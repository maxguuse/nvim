# My personal Neovim configuration
First of all, I do not guarantee any stability or convenience for anyone who decides to use this configuration. 
I designed it for my personal use and it can be changed or even fully rewritten at any given moment.

# Plugins
> You can see used plugins on [dotfyle](https://dotfyle.com/maxguuse/nvim).

# My own customization
In addition to those plugins I wrote my own simple wrappers around Neovims' builtin arglist and mksession to replicate bookmarks(yeah sessions can be used to store other useful stuff but I mainly use them to save arglists)
They are stored in `lua/core` directory.
